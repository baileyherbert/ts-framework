# @ts-framework/express

This package integrates [express](https://www.npmjs.com/express) with
[ts-framework](https://www.npmjs.com/@ts-framework/framework) such that you can easily create routes from methods in
your controllers.

A dedicated framework like [nest](https://nestjs.com/) is recommended for building APIs and web applications. You can
add `ts-framework` to a nest project to get the best of both worlds.
