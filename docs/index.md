# Introduction

## Concept

This is a framework for building applications and services of all kinds. It's a logic framework for modular development.
It's a framework for building a fantastic developer experience. It's a framework for building frameworks.

While other frameworks offer features to achieve a set of focused goals, this framework allows the developer to define
the goals, and provides tools to quickly and easily build a tailored platform that supports them.

It's also modular. If you design your modules to work independently, you can easily import and reuse them across your
applications. You can also import third party modules to quickly add additional functionality.

## Use cases

### Frameworks

This framework is so powerful that you could recreate the Nest.js framework almost entirely with its built-in
features. It features a similar module, service, and controller system as well.

I'm not saying you should do that, of course. I'm merely using it as an example of how you can easily create your own
customized framework.

### Copilot

This framework is also designed to work alongside other applications and frameworks, especially in the same process. It
can be a copilot, if you will.

Imagine building a web service that has a pretty complicated backend. You can use this framework for the backend system,
since it has many features that make such development easier, and then use NestJS alongside it as a public interface.

### Front end

This framework isn't solely for the server side. One of its main goals is to run alongside front-end frameworks and
libraries, such as React and Svelte.

features of the framework and how you can use them to achieve great things.
